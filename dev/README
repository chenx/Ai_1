- Added captcha in Chinese.
  getpwd_cn.php, for example, now can use Chinese captcha.
  - New folder captcha contains the testing code, and final working code.
    The key is to load a font library that contains Chinese fonts.
    Then use function imagettftext() to draw the Chinese characters.
    Also need to set the web files to use UTF-8 font, and include meta header to use UTF-8 too.
  - Now captcha.php and captcha_cn.php are both copied into /func.
    captcha.php generates captcha image using English characters and numbers.
    captcha_cn.php generates captcha image using Chinese characters.
    The font library file is included in /func.

- Make payment using papal.
  Add this function for e-commerce website.
  https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/paypal-payments-standard/ht_create-pps-buttons/
  Paypal transaction fee is: 2.9% + $0.3, see here:
  https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-standard
  - Question:
    After transaction, I will receive an email about it.
    This is not a problem if I ship the product to the user.
    But if I let the user download something after purchase, how do I know?
    - See: https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/use-cases/

- change all <?= to <? echo, so no more compatibility issue on mac.
- change profile.php to profile_v0.php, and adapt register.php to profile.php.
  profile_v0.php is: edit -> submit -> update
  prfile.php     is: edit -> verify -> submit -> update
  Cls_DBTable.php is changed accordingly.
- in admin_images.php, don't display folder names starting with ".".
- For page height of admin_images.php, maybe can get the height in index.php, and store it as a session variable.

- String.trim() does not work in IE. So
    if (document.getElementById('txtLogin').value.trim() == '' ||
        document.getElementById('txtCaptcha').value.trim() == '') {
    //if ($.trim( $("#txtLogin").val() ) == '' || $.trim( $("#txtCaptcha").val() ) == "") {
    //    alert("Please enter both login name and image code.");
    } else {
        document.forms[0].submit();
    }
  will fail in IE, which reports javascript error.
  Use jQuery instead. See code in comment above.
- CSS dropdown menu does not work in IE. Use javascript instead should make it work.

- Update captcha image.
  for firefox, it won't reload if the image src is the same.
  So trick it to think the url is differet by using a random variable.

  function changeCaptcha(o) {
    // for firefox, it won't reload if the image src is the same.
    // So trick it to think the url is differet by using a random variable.

    //$("#imgC").attr('src', "captcha.php?" + Math.random());
    document.getElementById('imgC').src = "captcha.php?" + Math.random();

    // Use this to avoid clicking the button to frequently, and server side memory usage
    // will soar: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=581886&p=3042312
    // when o is an image, o.disabled is useful for IE only.
    // If o is a button, it works in all.
    o.disabled = true;
    setTimeout(enableButton, 500);
    //o.disabled = false;
 }

  function enableButton() {
    document.getElementById('btnChange').disabled = false;
  }

- Need to add verify page for admin edit table function.
  This can be second paradigm.
  Verify page is needed for register in general. 
  But for admin it's optional.
- For verify page, posted back parameters need be html_encoded to keep orginal value,
  otherwise special chars like " or <, > can cause problem.

- Use multiple select in file upload dialog:
  HTML5 allows this.
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1175347/how-can-i-select-and-upload-multiple-files-with-html-and-php-using-http-post
  This is compatile with browsers that do not support HTML5 (e.g. IE), in such situation only 1 file is upload.
- Use multiple lines in javascritp alert(): "\\n"

- Added page: Manage Image.
  - To dynamically obtain page height, so to make file list height just in page height,
    in menu.php and adminhome.php, get $(window).height() in javascript, open the page
    admin_images.php using javascript window.location.href, pass win_h, then in the
    admin_images.php page, use a hidden form variable to keep windows height.
- after window resize, update win_h.
